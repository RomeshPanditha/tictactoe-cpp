# tictactoe-cpp


a small single-player game that I designed and implemented as a console application with C++. I designed/implemented the game logic (player turns, win conditions etc.), created the AI’s choice algorithm (for deciding appropriate turns to make), and implemented the data structures required for the game’s AI to function.
